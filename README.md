# Radio Module based on the SI4732

An ATS-20 Radio port in 3U height. Jumpers on the PCB lets the device be used as an Eurorack module or as a standalone all-band receiver.

A regular 12VDC wall wart or a 9V battery can be used for standalone usage.

The module that you see in the picture above is using circuit boards that were fabricated by [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) They have excellent build quality and I can recommend using their service to build your own projects! I used the "Black" option for the soldermask and the surface has very deep and glossy black finish, which looks amazing, they also have an option for a "Matte Black" finish which I will try next time. Thank you PCBWay for sponsoring this module. 
This is the first project that features a small OLED display, and thus the first project where I cut out a square section from the frontplate. This worked out really well and the corners are clean 90 degrees with no rounding. They are also having a 3D printing service, which means you can order the boards and the case for this radio all in one place.
