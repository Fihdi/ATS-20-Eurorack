# Radio Module based on the SI4732

An ATS-20 Radio port in 3U height. Jumpers on the PCB lets the device be used as an Eurorack module or as a standalone all-band receiver.

A regular 12VDC wall wart or a 9V battery can be used for standalone usage.

The module that you see in the picture above is using circuit boards that were fabricated by PCBWay. They have excellent build quality and I can recommend using their service to build your own projects! I used the "Black" option for the soldermask and the surface has very deep and glossy black finish, which looks amazing, they also have an option for a "Matte Black" finish which I will try next time. Thank you PCBWay for sponsoring this module.
